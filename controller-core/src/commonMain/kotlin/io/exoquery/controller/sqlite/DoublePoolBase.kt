/**
 * Since in Sqlite WAL mode you can create a MVCC-like behavior by allowing a single writer and multiple readers,
 * this pool is designed around this behavior. Users/subclassers of this pool can have either one connection for both
 * reads and writes (i.e. the non-WAL mode where both borrowWriter and borrowReader return the same connection)
 * or have a single reader and multiple writers. In the latter case, the number of readers should typically be
 * specified in the constructor.
 *
 * Note that the writer does not block the reader and the readers don't block the writer you should not
 * have any situations of starvation. In practice it seems that in situations in high fiber-contention
 * due to GC pauses a large group of readers being constantly spun up can cause indefinitely block
 * the coroutines. A possible future direction is to introduce reader timeouts or some other mechanism
 * to prevent overly aggressive readers.
